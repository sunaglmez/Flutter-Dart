# Collection Structures in Dart

Collection structures are classes used to group objects together. They allow us to store the same type or different types of values in a single variable. Just like in other programming languages, collection structures are widely used in Dart. So, what are these lists? Until now, we have always worked with variables, assigning a single value to each one. But what if we want to store a group of values in a variable-like manner? This is where the importance of lists comes into play.

## What Are Collection Structures?

Collection structures are classes that group objects or values together. When we want to store multiple values in a single variable, these structures come into play. For example, while a variable can hold only a single value (like an integer or a string), collection structures allow us to hold multiple values.

## Lists

Lists are one of the collection structures and they store an ordered collection of values. In Dart, lists can hold values of the same type or different types, providing flexibility during programming. For example, you can have a list that contains integers, strings, and other objects all together.

## The Importance of Using Lists:
When we want to store multiple values in a single variable, lists offer great convenience. For example, if you want to store a student's grades:
```dart
List<int> grades = [85, 90, 78, 92];
```
Here, the `grades` list holds the studentâ€™s grades in a single variable. This makes it easier to perform operations on the grades, such as looping through them, searching for a specific grade, or updating grades.
