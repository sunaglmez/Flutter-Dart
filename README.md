   - Open Android Studio, go to the `AVD Manager` (Android Virtual Device Manager), and create a new virtual device.

2. **iOS Simulator**
   - For iOS development, you will need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to set up an iOS simulator.
   - Open Xcode, go to `Xcode` > `Preferences` > `Components`, and install the iOS simulator.

For physical devices:

- Enable USB debugging on your Android device by going to `Settings` > `Developer options` and turning on `USB debugging`.
- Connect the device to your computer via USB.

### Install Visual Studio Code Extensions
