# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Dart
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm used in software development, where the term "object" refers to an independent structure with specific attributes and functions in a software context. The similarity of this concept to real-world objects makes OOP easier to understand.

## Real-World Objects

In the real world, an "object" is something that exists physically and has the following characteristics:

- **Physical Attributes**: An object has physical properties such as weight, mass, color, and material.
- **Interaction**: An object interacts with its surroundings. For example, a car can move, a door can open, and a computer can operate.

These features show that real-world objects are distinct and identifiable entities.

## Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Class and Object are fundamental concepts in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. To understand these concepts better, let's begin with an analogy from the real world.

## 1. What is a Class?

A class can be thought of as a blueprint, template, or plan that defines what an object will look like and how it will behave. In the world of software development, a class defines the attributes (variables) and the behaviors (functions/methods) that can be performed on those attributes.

### Real-World Analogy:
A class can be compared to a blueprint for building a house. The blueprint defines the house's characteristics (how many rooms, how many windows, what kind of roof, etc.) and how it should be built. However, the blueprint itself is not a house, it is just a model.

### In Software:
A class in software is a model that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. In a class:
- **Variables**: Store the object's properties (color, size, name, etc.).
- **Methods (Functions)**: Define the object's behaviors (move, speak, calculate, etc.).

## What is an Object?

An object is a concrete instance created from a class. In other words, if the class (blueprint) is not a house itself, the object is the actual house created from that plan. Each object contains the properties and functions defined in its class.

### Real-World Analogy:
From a house blueprint (class), multiple real houses (objects) can be built. Each house can have its own color, windows, and doors, but all are built according to the same plan.

### In Software:
An object is an entity created from a class that occupies space in memory. Objects are created by instantiating a class, and each object has its own properties and behaviors, while following the rules defined by the class.

## Relationship Between Class and Object

- **Class**: Defines what an object is and how it behaves (blueprint).
- **Object**: A real instance created from a class that occupies space in memory.

Once a class is defined, multiple objects can be created based on that class. Each object shares the same characteristics defined by the class but may hold its own unique values and states.

## Why Do We Use Objects and Classes?
Couldnâ€™t we just use Lists and Maps?
The answer is simple: No, they are not enough. If we try to force Lists or Maps to cover everything, things would quickly become chaotic. A list can only hold limited types of data, and while we can use a map to describe the properties of a person, trying to describe the attributes of many people with maps would require nested maps, leading to complexity and confusion.

## Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
1. **Abstraction**  
   Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

2. **Encapsulation**  
   Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components for better security and control.

3. **Inheritance**  
   Inheritance allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. This promotes code reusability.

4. **Polymorphism**  
   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows one method to perform different tasks based on the object it is acting upon.

These principles are foundational to object-oriented programming and will be covered in more detail with practical examples in future articles. However, I know that these concepts are often asked during interviews or in academic settings, so I wanted to provide a brief overview for now.
